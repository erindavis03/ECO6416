A Florida health insurance company wants to predict annual claims for individual clients. The company pulls a random sample of 100 customers. The owner wishes to charge an actuarially fair premium to ensure a normal rate of return. The owner collects all of their current customer’s health care expenses from the last year and compares them with what is known about each customer’s plan. 

The data on the 100 customers in the sample is as follows:

-	Charges: Total medical expenses for a particular insurance plan (in dollars)
-	Age: Age of the primary beneficiary
-	BMI: Primary beneficiary’s body mass index (kg/m2)
-	Female: Primary beneficiary’s birth sex (0 = Male, 1 = Female)
-	Children: Number of children covered by health insurance plan (includes other dependents as well)
-	Smoker: Indicator if primary beneficiary is a smoker (0 = non-smoker, 1 = smoker)
-	Cities: Dummy variables for each city with the default being Sanford

Answer the following questions using complete sentences and attach all output, plots, etc. within this report.


```{r dataset, include=FALSE}
insurance <- read.csv("../Data/Insurance_Data_Group3.csv")
```



## Question 1

Generate this regression equation:

$$Charges = \beta_{0}+\beta_{1}*Age+\beta_{2}*BMI+\beta_{3}*Children + \beta_{4}*Female + \beta_{5}*Smoker + \beta_{6}*WinterSprings + \beta_{7}*WinterPark + \beta_{8}*Oviedo$$

```{r q1}
model <- lm(Charges ~ Age + BMI + Children + Female + Smoker + WinterSprings + WinterPark + Oviedo, data = insurance)
summary(model) 


```
#Regression equation:
Charges = -5408.77 +300.88(Age) + 98.67(BMI) - 260.54(Children) - 770.49(Female) + 24287.83(Smoker) - 870.90(WinterSprings) + 785.37(WinterPark) - 2682.81(Oviedo)

Which independent variables test significant in a two-tailed test? Use $\alpha = 0.2$
# To determine which independent variables are significant in a regression model, you typically look at the p-values associated with each coefficient estimate. In the context of the question, we want to test the significance of the coefficients using a significance level of 0.2 (a=0.2)

Age, Smoker, and Oviedo are the significant variables in the model.

## Question 2

Interpret the coefficients of all the independent variables that tested significant.(add margin of error standard of error is 1.3)

Age: The variable tests signifcant and has a positive coefficient, this means age is directly correlated to the amount charged for insurance and the higher your age, the more you will be charged. The margin of error is calculated by multiplying 1.3 (80% confidence) by 36.46 which is approximately 47. This means that for every year increase in age, there will be a 300 dollar increase in charges, give or take 47.

Smoker: The variable tests signifcant and has a positive coefficient, this means being a smoker will directly affect the amount charged for insurance. The margin of error is calculated by multiplying 1.3 (80% confidence) by 1,484.07 which is approximately 1,930. This means if you're a smoker, there will be a 24,287.83 dollar increase in charges, give or take 1,930.

Oviedo: The variable tests signifcant and has a negative coefficient, this means living in Oviedo will decrease your insurance charges by $2,682.81.(compare to sanford)

## Question 3

The insurance agent returns with another client:

- Age: 35
- BMI: 26
- Children: 1
- Gender: Female
- Smoker: No
- City: Sanford

Using the regression equation above, predict the amount of medical expenses associated with this policy. (Provide a 95% confidence interval as well)

```{r q3}

new_client <- data.frame(Age = 35, BMI = 26, Children = 1, Female = 1, Smoker = 0, WinterSprings = 0, WinterPark = 0, Oviedo = 0)
prediction <- predict(model, newdata = new_client, interval = "confidence")
prediction

```

## Question 4

Compare the model from question 1, to a model that does not include the group of city dummies. Does including the cities reduce the SSE by a statistically significant amount? (check the partial F-test for significance of the dummies as a group). Use $\alpha = 0.05$

```{r q4}

```
